This is a project to play a states and capitals game.

Deps:
pytesseract
Image
pynput

Math:
I learned about functions and looping an input through the function

Resources:
  Image (PIL.Image):
pip3 install Pillow
  Pynput:
pip3 install pynput
  Pytesseract:

  Game page:
http://www.abcya.com/us_states_and_capitals.htm

Starting by allowing buttons to move the mouse to the correct position and clicking in a grid to be able to do the smaller states.
I am using pynput to controll the mouse to click in different spots on the screen where the state that matches the capital is.

I will do this by moving the mouse into the top left corner then I will move the mouse to the correct position to click on the state.  I also need to have some way to get stat from the screen to find out which capital is being displayed and where the state is.

I am moving on to the image processing. This is the harder part as I have to get pytesseract working. I was trying to install it using pip3 install pytesseract but it was not working. I went to the first link in Resources-Pytesseract and followed the instructions there changing the version from 73 to 78 and downloading the source from the website.
I have installed tesseract and am now downloading the lang files. This should alow me to use the package properly. I can now import it and start it and get a error for no lang defined. this is better than the one that was not in path.
