#This shold solve the sudoku problems using several methods. The first will be trying to solve just using the numbers in the colum then next will be using the rows then the boxex. These methods will be additive meaning that if one does not work you should be able to pass the output from one into another for furthur refinement. I also want to try to solve the puxxle by trying every number to see if it works in that spot. For this reason I will be importing the file as a dict so that I can assign every plase the possible numbers.
